"""
Keep it simple! Write a function to do only one thing,
and do it well. If a function needs to do several things,
then break it up into smaller functions.
Keep functions short. 10 to 20 lines of code is the maximum
needed per function. If you find that you need to write more
than this then consider breaking up your function into
several smaller functions.
Use few function parameters. This makes code easier to read.
Aim to use up to 3 parameters. If a function requires more,
consider passing a container as a parameter instead.
Use meaningful variable names and be consistent.
Use grouping of code blocks to make code easier to read.
Avoid deep nesting of statements. Deeply nested code is
difficult to test and debug. Consider alternative approaches
where possible.
Always use the DRY principle. DRY stands for "Do Not Repeat Yourself".
Where logic has been written in code, it should only be written once.
If not then consider writing a function to reuse the logic.
Limit the line length of code. Avoid writing horizontally
long lines of code. You have practised how to do this for
writing code that contains strings and condition statements.
Our eyes are more comfortable when reading tall and narrow
columns of text.

Try to separate code and data. There are many ways of achieving this,
 some of which have yet to be covered in the course.
 Consider using functions to return data, rather than using print
 statements within the functions.
Refactor your code! Go back to your saved programs and
improve upon them every time you learn new skills.
